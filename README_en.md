## How to use

The music and video libraries will scan all media files (including subdirectories) in the library directory.

For music, the `cover.jpg` in the same directory will be used as the cover. Videos will have thumbnails automatically generated by `ffmpeg` (system environment variable needed; Android support is uncertain).

Supported formats: `avi`, `flv`, `mkv`, `mov`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `webm`, `wmv`, `aac`, `midi`, `mp3`, `ogg`, `wav`
